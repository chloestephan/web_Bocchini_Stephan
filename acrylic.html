                    This faux nail method is ideal for those of us who want long nails, but can't or maintain their ideal nail length or shape on their own. However, they're not exactly effortless: getting acrylic nails comes with a price tag, and the upkeep does, too. Additionally, acrylics can damage your nails if they're done wrong. 
                </p>
                <h3><span>What does it consist of?</span></h3>
                <p>
                    Acrylic nails are made out of a liquid powder and are being sculpted directly onto your nails. Most of the time this mixture will cover the entire nail and not just the nail bed. Now the thing with this liquid powder is that – the longer it is exposed to the air, the more it hardens. That is the reason why you always end up with hard, stiff, and long lasting nails.

                    <h3><span>How are they applied?</span></h3>
                    <p>
                        When you're getting a full set of acrylics, the nail technician will usually put on tips, or use nail forms to achieve a more natural look. Each acrylic is then shaped as desired and then painted with polish. <br>
                        <br>It's safe to get acrylics as often as you wish, but research nail technicians in your area so that you're sure you go to someone who is properly trained and experienced in applying them. 
                    </p>

                    <h3><span>Refill</span></h3>
                    <p>Your natural nails will start to grow, and sooner or later, you will notice that your nails will require a refill. <br>Rush to the salon every 3 weeks to get them as fresh as possible.</p>

                    <h3><span>How do you remove them?</span></h3>
                    <p>It’s the best if you don’t try this at home because people often injure themselves easily when removing them on their own. <br>Removing acrylic nails isn't all that different from taking off a gel manicure. Acrylics should be removed by soaking each nail in acetone until the acrylic is soft enough to remove gently. It is best to have a professional remove them to avoid damage to your nail bed. </p>
