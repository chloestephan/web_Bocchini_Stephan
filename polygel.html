                <p>
                    The liquid used to sculpt PolyGel is called Slip — the name was inspired by the slip potters use when working with clay. Slip is not a monomer; it has no active ingredients, and unlike acrylic monomer, it has a light, pleasant fragrance. It’s simply used to make the PolyGel easy to shape.
                    <br>Unlike hard gel, PolyGel is not self-leveling, but stays where you place it; unlike acrylic, it doesn’t harden until it’s cured in an LED or UV lamp.
                    Cure time is about 30 seconds in an LED lamp or two minutes in a UV lamp. PolyGel nails do not experience heat spikes during curing. There is no tacky layer after curing.
                    <br>PolyGel is more flexible than acrylic, stronger than hard gel, and lighter than both, according to Gelish.
                    The product can be applied as an overlay over natural nails, a tip overlay, or sculpted over a form.
                    It’s available in six colors: bright white, natural clear, soft white, soft pink, dark pink, and cover pink.
                    Gel-polish colors can be applied over the product, and Gelish can be mixed with PolyGel to create a design.
                    <br>Natural nail prep is the same as prep for gel. Nail techs can use an e-file or a hand file to shape the product.
                    The product should be filed off, not soaked off. Nail techs can soak to remove the remaining product after filing. 
                    PolyGel nails can be rebalanced the same way acrylic or gel nails are rebalanced.

                <h3><span>How to remove</span></h3>
                <p>There are several ways you can remove the poly gel from your nails but neither of them is quick and instant.  You need to give time on the process or else you can risk harming your natural nail bed.
                    <br>All of the following processes firstly require cutting the nail length as short as possible to make the removing process easier.                    
                    In this first process, we are discussing requires less filing or buffering as possible, that is, some people choose to soak the whole nail in acetone for a long period of time to let the acetone soften the poly gel and then scrape it off as usual.                    
                    You might need to buff your nail finally to remove any access poly gel. The positive side of this process is it involves less filing and buffering thus less chance of damage to your natural nails.                   
                    But you cannot ignore the changes of harm that acetone can do to your skin for soaking them for so long.
                    Also, this process takes a lot of time and the time depends on how thick you made your poly gel nails. The more thickly the more time it will take to soften the nail. Yet it is a good option if you want to avoid filing and buffing.   
                    <br><br>The second way consists of both filing and buffing. There are many kinds of filer and buffers in the market and you will need around 100 to 120-grade nail filers and file the poly gel from your nails.
                    
                    But make sure not to overdo it or you can risk scratching or harming your natural nails. After you are satisfied with the filing you can buff away any scathes by buffing them off with a good quality buffer mostly around 240 grades.
                    
                    Finally, remove the excess dust to reveal your natural beautiful nails.
                    
                    <br><br>The third process includes automatic or motorized nail filers. If you are into nails and regularly do poly gel nails and frequently change your nail art, you can easily invest in one of these.
                    
                    This will definitely save you a lot of time and work. The process is the same as hand nail filers. You need to file your nails as thin as possible then buff them off. Some also prefer to use both motorized and hand filers together.
                    
                    First, filing off most of the poly gel with the automatic one, and then filing off the remaining with the hand filers. This results in smoother and satisfactory results.
                    
                    <br><br>The fourth and final way is a hybrid of all of the systems above, which is, first you go with your automatic nail filer, file most of the poly gel, then file with your regular filer.
                    
                    To avoid direct contact with natural nails, you can keep a thin layer of poly gel behind. And then soak the nails in acetone to soak the remaining poly gel to scrape them off finally. And then buff any damage or scratches if occurred.
                    
                    This process can provide fewer scratches or damage to your natural nails as possible. Also, minimizing the skin damage too as the soaking process will take lesser time than soaking the whole poly gel nail without any filing.
                    
                    This process might take a bit more activities to be done but eventually provide you with a beautiful and smooth nail for your next nail art.
                    
                   <br><br>Lastly, do not forget to moisturize those nails and cuticles with good nail oil or nail cream. Nail oils are more preferable for better absorption.</p>
