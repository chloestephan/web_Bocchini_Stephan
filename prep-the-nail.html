                <h3>Preping your nails correctly is very important in order to get the best outcome possible. Preparing your nails allows them to be fully visible and workable and it also prevents lifting or damaging the nail.</h3>

                        <h4>What is lifting?</h4>
                        <p>Lifting means that there is a space between your extension (whether it is acrylic, gel, polygel, semi-permanent, etc.) and your natural nail.</p>
                        <p>It can happen for various reasons:
                        <br>- The natural nail was still socked in natural oils when putting the product on so the extension can't fully adhere.
                        <br>- The nail wasn't well prepped. 
                        <br>- The product wasn't well applied.
                        <br>- The time between fill-ins was too long.
                        <br>- The curing lamp wasn't suitable enough.
                        <br>- The nails are in poor conditions, such as really pourous.
                        </p>

                            <p>Let's take a closer look at the state of our nail before starting the cleaning up process. The cuticle are very proeminent here.</p>

                            <p>We start by pushing the cuticle back. You can use a cuticle softener and a cuticle pusher to push the cuticle off of the nail plate. When pushing the cuticle you want to use a small circular motion. It’s also important to use a cuticle softener that doesn’t have oils in it since the objective is to keep the nails free of oil and moisture during prep.</p>

                            <p>The cuticle is detached from the nail. We can now remove it easily and safely.</p>

                            <p>We scrap the cuticle bits that could still be on the nail plate. We thus ensure full adhesion later on.</p>

                            <p>We can now cut the cuticle. You can nip the excess dead skin visible, but this needs to be done very carefully. You only want to nip the dead skin which appears white in color, and not any live tissue (the eponychium). We use these comfort grip nippers. When nipping, be sure not to pull on the skin – cut in a clean motion. </p>

                            <p>After caring for the cuticle, buff the nail plate with a fine grit (240/280) buffer. This will help loosen any remaining dead skin from the nail plate and also remove the shine. Be sure to buff the entire nail plate from edge to edge!</p>

                            <h4 class="align-center">Step 8: Cleansing</h4>
                            <p>After buffing you will need to remove all of the debris from the nails as well as any excess oils using a lint-free wipe and cleanser. You need to use a 99% isopropyl alcohol-based cleanser to really dehydrate the nail plate and remove the oils for optimal adhesion.</p>

                            <h4 class="align-center">Step 9: Priming</h4>
                            <p>After cleansing the nail you can also optionally use a prep solution, bonder or primer. Many prep solutions are alcohol-based and help dehydrate the nail plate further. Primers are solutions that help with adhesion and should only be used if you often experience issues with premature lifting or chipping. It is recommended only using primers on the tips or areas where lifting and chipping occur. If you use a primer on the whole nail, removal could be very difficult.</p>

                        <div id="step10">
                            <h4 class="align-center">Step 10: You do you boo !</h4>
                            <p>You are good to go. Allow the cleanser, bonder and/or primer to completely air dry before proceeding with your gel polish application.</p>
                        </div>

                <div class="row">
                    <p>Preping is really important so that your hard work stays as long as possible and so that you get to enjoy your nails to the fullest. The cuticle is the dead skin that attaches to the nail plate at the base of the nail, and it needs to be properly pushed back and removed from the nail so that your gel polish can adhere properly.  If you apply polish over the cuticle you will almost definitely have premature lifting around the edges.</p>
